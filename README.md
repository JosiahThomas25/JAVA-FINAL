Project Overview
Goal: This program provides an automated interface for a  PC repair business. It allows users to select high-end computer components and technical repair services, calculates a total with a text file, and schedules a delivery appointment within business hours.

Functionality:

1. Store Catalog -> Uses an array-based system to store products and services.
2. Validates user-inputted times against business operation hours 
3. Generates a professional receipt and exports it to a local text file (OrderReceipt.txt).

Technical Components Implemented
This project satisfies the following technical requirements:
Object-Oriented Design: 
Encapsulation: 
Control Flow: 
Data Handling: 
Imports java.io packages to handle persistent data storage.

Strengths & Weaknesses
Strength: The use of an interface and polymorphism allows the program be easily updated because of its modular system.

Weakness: The program uses fixed-size arrays for the shopping cart. Additionally, input validation is currently basic and could be improved with try-catch blocks for non-numeric inputs.

Future Improvements
Integration of Java Swing for a graphical user interface.

Transition from fixed Arrays to larger lists for unlimited cart sizes.

Implementation of a dynamic tracking system for different employee service hours
